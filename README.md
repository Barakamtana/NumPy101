I wrote this code as part of the Data Analyst Complete Bootcamp by Udemy
This code helped cover NumPy package extensively.
In this code, I read a csv file into Jupiter notebook, perform data cleaning on intergers and string.
After cleaning, I write the complete and clean data set into my local storage
